# Research Portfolio
_Nicholas J. Tustison, DSc_

## I.  Research Statement

As research support faculty in the Department of Radiology and Medical Imaging at
UVa, my primary research focus is the development of high quality and robust
software for processing of medical imaging data and corresponding analysis
strategies for these data.  To put it simply and generally, I am a data scientist
who operates at the nexus of "big data", statistical science (including machine
learning), and software development for gaining insight into human systems
(specifically brain, lung, and heart).  

### A.  Major Contributor to The Insight Toolkit

Addressing the deficiency of image processing tools for analyzing the Visible
Human Project in 1999, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) funded the Insight Toolkit (ITK) initiative bringing together such
academic institutions as the University of Pennsylvania and the University of North
Carolina, along with various industrial partners, such as GE Research.  This
effort resulted in the Insight Toolkit---a comprehensive, open-source suite of
codified algorithms for medical image analysis.  Development and expansion continues
to the present and is heavily utilized by industry and academia worldwide and, due
to its generalizability, has been adopted by the French space agency (CNES) for the
processing of remote-sensing imagery.  

__Open source software contributions.__  I have provided several key developments to
the Insight Toolkit which is one of the
primary venues for my software contributions and influence in the field.
These contributions are listed in the accompanying CV in Section IX, Subsection C
_Open-Source Software Short Communications_.  Starting
from my first contribution in 2005 (_$N$-D $C^k$ B-Spline Scattered Data Approximation_),
I have continued to provide open-source algorithmic implementations to the Insight Toolkit
including my latest contribution made recently on August 27, 2016 (_Two Luis Miguel fans walk into a
bar in Nagoya ---> (yada, yada, yada) ---> an ITK-implementation of a popular
patch-based denoising filter_).  Other important contributions include
operations for image convolution (_Image Kernel Convolution_), faux Colormapping
(_Meeting Andy Warhol Somewhere Over the Rainbow: RGB Colormapping and ITK_), and
fundamental measures for evaluating segmentation results (_Introducing Dice,
Jaccard, and Other Label Overlap Measures To ITK_).   These software classes have
been downloaded over 67,413 times (average = 2,931 downloads).  

__N4 for MRI bias correction.__
Of all these contributions, perhaps my most significant is a method for removing
the low frequency inhomogeneity artifacts common to MR images as an important preprocessing step for
MR image analysis.  This algorithm is commonly referred to in the literature as
"N4" or "Nick's nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization" which is
described in the following publication:

> Tustison NJ, Avants BB, Cook PA, Egan A, Zheng Y, Yushkevich PA, and Gee JC.  N4ITK: Improved N3 Bias Correction, _IEEE Trans Med Imaging_, 29(6):1310–1320, June 2010. Cited 367 times; IF = 3.390; Rank 5 out of 100 computer science, interdisciplinary applications, 12 out of 76 biomedical engineering, 18 out of 249 electrical & electronic engineering, 3 out of 24 imaging science & photographic technology, 21 out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging.

It is a significant extension of the popular N3 algorithm[^1] (introduced in 1998
with currently ~3,000 citations).  Prior to the N4 formal publication, it was provided
as open-source software to the ITK community:

> Tustison NJ, Gee JC: N4ITK: Nick’s N3 ITK Implementation for MRI Bias Field Correction, _Insight Journal_, 2009, http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3053.

where it has been downloaded over 10,000 times.

__ITKv4 Image Registration Refactoring.__
Image registration (or the alignment of corresponding features between two images)
is a fundamental component in medical image processing and analysis.
In 2011 the NIH-NLM sponsored a large-scale funding effort to "modernize" the Insight
Toolkit.  One of the three major contracts was to provide modern image registration
techniques requiring a complete refactoring of the existing image registration
framework.  This contract was awarded to a joint team consisting of
myself and collaborators from the University of Pennsylvania (under the direction
 of Professor James C. Gee):  

> Sponsor:  	NIH-NLM  
> Title:    	_Fundamental Refactoring of Deformable Image Registration in ITK with Distributed Computing and GPU Acceleration_  
> Role:	    	Principle investigator of UVa subcontract  
> Period:    7/1/2011 – 6/30/2012  

This team provided several major image registration upgrades to the algorithmic
toolkit where I wrote a significant portion of the actual software code.  Not only
did we implement current image registration technologies for inclusion but we also
developed new and innovative techniques which were also included:

>  Tustison NJ and Avants BB. Explicit B-spline regularization in diffeomorphic image registration. _Front Neuroinform_, 7:39, 2013.  Cited 21 times; IF = 3.261; Rank 8 out of 57 mathematical & computational biology, 105 out of 252 neurosciences.

>  Avants BB, Tustison NJ, Stauffer M, Song G, Wu B, and Gee JC. The Insight ToolKit Image Registration Framework. _Front Neuroinform_, 8:44, 2014.  Cited 29 times; IF = 3.261; Rank 8 out of 57 mathematical & computational biology, 105 out of 252 neurosciences.

__ITK-Lung:  A Software Framework for Lung Image Processing and Analysis.__
Consistent with our previous work, Professor James C. Gee and I recently submitted
an NIH R01 grant for the development of ITK-Lung, a set of open-source software
tools for CT, PET, MRI pulmonary image analysis based on the Insight ToolKit.
Specifically, we plan to provide core algorithms for specific pulmonary image
analysis tasks across multiple modalities, many of which I have included with
previous publications. These basic tasks include intra- and inter-modal pulmonary
image registration, template building for cross-sectional and longitudinal (i.e.,
respiratory cycle) analyses, functional and structural lung image segmentation,
perfusion analysis, and computation of quantitative image indices as potential
imaging biomarkers. These efforts would facilitate other NIH-sponsored projects
which interface specific pulmonary algorithms (e.g., CT nodule detection) with
clinical and research applications.  Over the course of this 5-year project, the
following UVa faculty and staff will be engaged:

* Nicholas J. Tustison, DSc, Principal Investigator (50% / year)
* Kun Qing, PhD, Co-investigator (15% / year)
* Y. Michael Shim, MD, Co-investigator (2% / year)
* W. Gerald Teague, MD, Co-investigator (2% / year)

### B. Co-Founder and Developer of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)

In the late 2000s my longtime colleague, Dr. Brian Avants, and I co-founded the Advanced Normalization
Tools (ANTs). ANTs is popularly considered a state-of-the-art medical image registration and segmentation toolkit based on ITK.  It is used by multiple academic institutions, research facilities (e.g., the Allen
Brain Institute, the Montreal Neurological Institute, the Laboratory of Neuroimaging at the University
of Southern California), and industry leaders (e.g., IBM Watson, GE Research).  In addition to
providing well-performing basic processing components, we have also engineered advanced pipelines
for obtaining key biomarkers for specific applications.  For example, measuring the thickness of
the cortical gray matter of the brain from MRI has long been used for assessing various neuropathologies and
normal longitudinal changes in the brain.  For a long time, the only publicly available resource
for performing this type of measurement was a software program called "FreeSurfer" which is developed
and made available from Mass General Hospital of Harvard University.  Recently, however,
I (along with several colleagues) created an ANTs-based pipeline which outperformed
FreeSurfer on a large, publicly available data set.  This work is described in

>	Tustison NJ, Cook PA, Klein A, Song G, Das SR, Duda JT, Kandel BM, van Strien N, Stone JR, Gee JC, and Avants BB. Large-Scale Evaluation of ANTs and FreeSurfer Cortical Thickness Measurements. _NeuroImage_, 99:166-179, Oct 2014.  Cited 46 times; IF = 6.357; Rank 1 out of 14 neuroimaging, 24 out of 252 neurosciences, 3 out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging.

All resulting quantities and corresponding scripts and analyses were made publicly available
for other people to use.  In fact, these measurements were used recently for investigating other
hypotheses:

Cited 0 times; IF = 1.734;  Rank 128 out of 192 clinical neurology, 12 out of 14 neuroimaging, and 65 out of 125 radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging.

__Competitions.__ Over the years our ANTs-based tools have won several international competitions:

* finished in the first rank in the Klein 2009 international brain mapping competition,[^2]

* finished first overall in the EMPIRE10 international lung mapping competition,[^3]

* was the standard registration tool for the MICCAI 2013 segmentation competitions,[^4]

* finished first in the BRATS 2013 challenge,[^5] and

* won the best paper award at the STACOM 2014 challenge.[^6]

We have provided these winning protocols to the public as open-source for continued
development.

__Tutorials and Other ANTs Informational Fora.__  I have given several
in-person workshops at the request of various research groups so that they can
better understand the various algorithms and pipelines of the ANTs toolkit.
These include the following:

* ANTs workshop, MD Anderson, Houston, TX, USA.  August 2016.

* ANTs Workshop for the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC), Baylor College, Houston, TX, USA. October 2015.

* SimpleITK tutorial, MICCAI, Munich, Germany. October 2015.

* ANTs workshop, Laboratory of Neuroimaging, Marina Del Rey, USA.  July 2015.

* CREATE-MIA Summer Workshop, ANTs Workshop, Montreal, Canada.  May 2015.

* SPIE Medical Imaging Workshop, Open source tools for medical image analysis, San Diego, USA.  February 2012.

In addition to these workshops, I typically answer 3--4 ANTs inquiries per day
originating from our Sourceforge or Github ANTs
repositories.  These inquiries range from instructions for specific programs to
providing analysis guidelines for large-scale studies.
