	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess how quantitative CT (qCT) metrics compare to pulmonary function testing (PFT) and semi-quantitative image scores (SQS) to diagnose bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), manifestation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation (LTx), according to the type of LTx (unilateral or bilateral).
METHODS: Paired inspiratory-expiratory CT scans and PFTs of 176 LTx patients were analyzed retrospectively, and separated into BOS (78) and non-BOS (98) cohorts. SQS were assessed by 2 radiologists and graded (0-3) for features including mosaic attenuation and bronchiectasis. qCT metrics included lung volumes and air trapping volumes. Multivariate logistic regression (MVLR) and support vector machines (SVM) were used for the classification task.
RESULTS: MVLR and SVM models using PFT metrics demonstrated highest accuracy for bilateral LTx (max AUC 0.771), whereas models using qCT metrics-only outperformed models using SQS or PFTs in unilateral LTx (max AUC 0.817), to diagnose BOS. Adding PC (principal components) from qCT on top of PFT improved model diagnostic accuracy for all transplant types.
CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of qCT metrics augment the diagnostic performance of PFTs, are superior to SQS to predict BOS status, and outperform PFTs in the unilateral LTx group. This suggests that latent information on paired volumetric CT may allow early diagnosis of BOS in LTx patients, particularly in unilateral LTx.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncertain prediction of outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) impedes individual patient management and clinical trial design.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiological metric of injurious inflation derived from matched inspiratory and expiratory CT scans, calibrate it in a model of experimental lung injury, and test it in patients with ARDS.
METHODS: 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed.
RESULTS: In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p<0.01). In patients with ARDS, a threshold fraction of tissue with unstable inflation was apparent: >28% in all patients who died and ≤28% in all who survived, whereas segregation of survivors versus non-survivors was not possible based on oxygenation or lung mechanics.
CONCLUSIONS: A single set of superimposed inspiratory-expiratory CT scans may predict progression of lung injury and outcome in ARDS; if these preliminary results are validated, this could facilitate clinical trial recruitment and individualised care.},

@article{Maga:2017aa,
	Abstract = {Laboratory mice are staples for evo/devo and genetics studies. Inbred strains provide a uniform genetic background to manipulate and understand gene-environment interactions, while their crosses have been instrumental in studies of genetic architecture, integration and modularity, and mapping of complex biological traits. Recently, there have been multiple large-scale studies of laboratory mice to further our understanding of the developmental basis, evolution, and genetic control of shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton (i.e. skull and mandible). These experiments typically use micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to capture the craniofacial phenotype in 3D and rely on manually annotated anatomical landmarks to conduct statistical shape analysis. Although the common choice for imaging modality and phenotyping provides the potential for collaborative research for even larger studies with more statistical power, the investigator (or lab-specific) nature of the data collection hampers these efforts. Investigators are rightly concerned that subtle differences in how anatomical landmarks were recorded will create systematic bias between studies that will eventually influence scientific findings. Even if researchers are willing to repeat landmark annotation on a combined dataset, different lab practices and software choices may create obstacles for standardization beyond the underlying imaging data. Here, we propose a freely available analysis system that could assist in the standardization of micro-CT studies in the mouse. Our proposal uses best practices developed in biomedical imaging and takes advantage of existing open-source software and imaging formats. Our first contribution is the creation of a synthetic template for the adult mouse craniofacial skeleton from 25 inbred strains and five F1 crosses that are widely used in biological research. The template contains a fully segmented cranium, left and right hemi-mandibles, endocranial space, and the first few cervical vertebrae. We have been using this template in our lab to segment and isolate cranial structures in an automated fashion from a mixed population of mice, including craniofacial mutants, aged 4-12.5 weeks. As a secondary contribution, we demonstrate an application of nearly automated shape analysis, using symmetric diffeomorphic image registration. This approach, which we call diGPA, closely approximates the popular generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) but negates the collection of anatomical landmarks. We achieve our goals by using the open-source advanced normalization tools (ANT) image quantification library, as well as its associated R library (ANTsR) for statistical image analysis. Finally, we make a plea to investigators to commit to using open imaging standards and software in their labs to the extent possible to increase the potential for data exchange and improve the reproducibility of findings. Future work will incorporate more anatomical detail (such as individual cranial bones, turbinals, dentition, middle ear ossicles) and more diversity into the template.},

	Abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a generally fatal neurodegenerative disease of adults that produces weakness and atrophy due to dysfunction and death of upper and lower motor neurons. We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze expression of all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded respiratory genes in ALS and CTL human cervical spinal cords (hCSC) and isolated motor neurons. We analyzed with RNA-seq mtDNA gene expression in human neural stem cells (hNSC) exposed to recombinant human mitochondrial transcription factor A (rhTFAM), visualized in 3-dimensions clustered gene networks activated by rhTFAM, quantitated their interactions with other genes and determined their gene ontology (GO) families. RNA-seq and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses showed reduced mitochondrial gene expression in ALS hCSC and ALS motor neurons isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM), and revealed that hNSC and CTL human cervical spinal cords were similar. Rats treated with i.v. rhTFAM showed a dose-response increase in brain respiration and an increase in spinal cord mitochondrial gene expression. Treatment of hNSC with rhTFAM increased expression of mtDNA-encoded respiratory genes and produced one major and several minor clusters of gene interactions. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of rhTFAM-stimulated gene clusters revealed enrichment in GO families involved in RNA and mRNA metabolism, suggesting mitochondrial-nuclear signaling. In postmortem ALS hCSC and LCM-isolated motor neurons we found reduced expression of mtDNA respiratory genes. In hNSC's rhTFAM increased mtDNA gene expression and stimulated mRNA metabolism by unclear mechanisms. rhTFAM may be useful in improving bioenergetic function in ALS.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This pilot study evaluated the effect of short- and long-term ivacaftor treatment on hyperpolarized (3)He-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined ventilation defects in patients with cystic fibrosis aged ≥12years with a G551D-CFTR mutation.
METHODS: Part A (single-blind) comprised 4weeks of ivacaftor treatment; Part B (open-label) comprised 48weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in total ventilation defect (TVD; total defect volume:total lung volume ratio).
RESULTS: Mean change in TVD ranged from -8.2% (p=0.0547) to -12.8% (p=0.0078) in Part A (n=8) and -6.3% (p=0.1953) to -9.0% (p=0.0547) in Part B (n=8) as assessed by human reader and computer algorithm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: TVD responded to ivacaftor therapy. (3)He-MRI provides an individual quantification of disease burden that may be able to detect aspects of the disease missed by population-based spirometry metrics. Assessments by human reader and computer algorithm exhibit similar trends, but the latter appears more sensitive. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01161537.},

@article{Wilde:2016aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important component of the multicentre Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) project is the development of improved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, including volumetric analysis. Although many studies routinely employ quality assurance (QA) procedures including MR and human phantoms to promote accuracy and monitor site differences, few studies perform rigorous direct comparisons of these data nor report findings that enable inference regarding site-to-site comparability. These gaps in evaluating cross-site differences are concerning, especially given the well-established differences that can occur between data acquired on scanners with different manufacturer, hardware or software.
METHODS: This study reports findings on (1) a series of studies utilizing two MR phantoms to interrogate machine-based variability using data collected on the same magnet, (2) a human phantom repeatedly imaged on the same scanner to investigate within-subject, within-site variability and (3) a human phantom imaged on three different scanners to examine within subject, between-site variability.
RESULTS: Although variability is relatively minimal for the phantom scanned on the same magnet, significantly more variability is introduced in a human subject, particularly when regions are relatively small or multiple sites used.
CONCLUSION: Vigilance when combining data from different sites is suggested and that future efforts address these issues.},

@article{Stone:2016aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are foci of abnormal signal intensity in white matter regions seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). WMHs are associated with normal ageing and have shown prognostic value in neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). The impracticality of manually quantifying these lesions limits their clinical utility and motivates the utilization of machine learning techniques for automated segmentation workflows.
METHODS: This study develops a concatenated random forest framework with image features for segmenting WMHs in a TBI cohort. The framework is built upon the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and ANTsR toolkits. MR (3D FLAIR, T2- and T1-weighted) images from 24 service members and veterans scanned in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium's (CENC) observational study were acquired. Manual annotations were employed for both training and evaluation using a leave-one-out strategy. Performance measures include sensitivity, positive predictive value, [Formula: see text] score and relative volume difference.
RESULTS: Final average results were: sensitivity = 0.68 $\pm$ 0.38, positive predictive value = 0.51 $\pm$ 0.40, [Formula: see text] = 0.52 $\pm$ 0.36, relative volume difference = 43 $\pm$ 26%. In addition, three lesion size ranges are selected to illustrate the variation in performance with lesion size.
CONCLUSION: Paired with correlative outcome data, supervised learning methods may allow for identification of imaging features predictive of diagnosis and prognosis in individual TBI patients.},

@article{Flors:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The assessment of early pulmonary disease and its severity can be difficult in young children, as procedures such as spirometry cannot be performed on them. Computed tomography provides detailed structural images of the pulmonary parenchyma, but its major drawback is that the patient is exposed to ionizing radiation. In this context, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising technique for the evaluation of pediatric lung disease, especially when serial imaging is needed. Traditionally, MRI played a small role in evaluating the pulmonary parenchyma. Because of its low proton density, the lungs display low signal intensity on conventional proton-based MRI. Hyperpolarized (HP) gases are inhaled contrast agents with an excellent safety profile and provide high signal within the lung, allowing for high temporal and spatial resolution imaging of the lung airspaces. Besides morphologic information, HP MR images also offer valuable information about pulmonary physiology. HP gas MRI has already made new contributions to the understanding of pediatric lung diseases and may become a clinically useful tool. In this article, we discuss the HP gas MRI technique, special considerations that need to be made when imaging children, and the role of MRI in 2 of the most common chronic pediatric lung diseases, asthma and cystic fibrosis. We also will discuss how HP gas MRI may be used to evaluate normal lung growth and development and the alterations occurring in chronic lung disease of prematurity and in patients with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia.},

@article{Filiano:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental disorders. Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal immunity influencing behaviour, such as spatial learning and memory. Here we show that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behaviour; mice deficient in adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to T-cell-derived cytokines suggest a strong interaction between social behaviour and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-driven responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-γ and increase GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid) currents in projection neurons, suggesting that IFN-γ is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural circuits recruited for social behaviour. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of a range of organisms reveals that rodents, fish, and flies elevate IFN-γ/JAK-STAT-dependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the IFN-γ signalling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link between social/aggregation behaviour and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-γ, in disorders characterized by social dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between social behaviour and an anti-pathogen immune response driven by IFN-γ signalling.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).
CONCLUSION: An annotated atlas library approach can be used to provide good lung and lobe estimation in proton MRI. The proposed framework is useful for subsequent anatomically based analysis of structural and/or functional pulmonary image data.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human entorhinal cortex (ERC) connects the temporal neocortex with hippocampus and is essential for memory retrieval and navigation. Markedly, there have been only few quantitative MRI works on the ERC geometric measurements in pediatric and adult healthy subjects across the lifespan. Here, we sought to fill this gap in knowledge by quantifying the ERC thickness in a very large cohort of subjects spanning 9 decades of life.
METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging data from multiple centers (IXI, MMRR, NKI, OASIS combined with the NIH-Child Dev database and locally recruited healthy subjects), we analyzed the lifespan trajectory of ERC thickness in 1,660 healthy controls ranging from 2 to 94 years of age.
RESULTS: The ERC thickness increased with age, reached a peak at about 44 years, and then decreased with age. ERC thickness is hemispherically rightward-asymmetric with no gender differences. Mean ERC thickness was found to vary between 2.943 $\pm$ .438 mm and 3.525 $\pm$ .355 mm across different age populations. Also, more pronounced loss of the ERC thickness in healthy aging men was noticeable.
DISCUSSION: Our report with high spatial resolution brain MRI data from 1,660 healthy controls provided important clues about ERC thickness across lifespan. We believe that our report will pave the way for the future studies investigating distinct neural pathologies related with cognitive dysfunctions.},

	Abstract = {The gold standard for identifying stroke lesions is manual tracing, a method that is known to be observer dependent and time consuming, thus impractical for big data studies. We propose LINDA (Lesion Identification with Neighborhood Data Analysis), an automated segmentation algorithm capable of learning the relationship between existing manual segmentations and a single T1-weighted MRI. A dataset of 60 left hemispheric chronic stroke patients is used to build the method and test it with k-fold and leave-one-out procedures. With respect to manual tracings, predicted lesion maps showed a mean dice overlap of 0.696 $\pm$ 0.16, Hausdorff distance of 17.9 $\pm$ 9.8 mm, and average displacement of 2.54 $\pm$ 1.38 mm. The manual and predicted lesion volumes correlated at r = 0.961. An additional dataset of 45 patients was utilized to test LINDA with independent data, achieving high accuracy rates and confirming its cross-institutional applicability. To investigate the cost of moving from manual tracings to automated segmentation, we performed comparative lesion-to-symptom mapping (LSM) on five behavioral scores. Predicted and manual lesions produced similar neuro-cognitive maps, albeit with some discussed discrepancies. Of note, region-wise LSM was more robust to the prediction error than voxel-wise LSM. Our results show that, while several limitations exist, our current results compete with or exceed the state-of-the-art, producing consistent predictions, very low failure rates, and transferable knowledge between labs. This work also establishes a new viewpoint on evaluating automated methods not only with segmentation accuracy but also with brain-behavior relationships.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a method for acquiring helium-3 ((3) He) and proton ((1) H) three-dimensional (3D) image sets of the human lung with isotropic spatial resolution within a 10-s breath-hold by using compressed sensing (CS) acceleration, and to assess the fidelity of undersampled images compared with fully sampled images.
METHODS: The undersampling scheme for CS acceleration was optimized and tested using (3) He ventilation data. Rapid 3D acquisition of both (3) He and (1) H data during one breath-hold was then implemented, based on a balanced steady-state free-precession pulse sequence, by random undersampling of k-space with reconstruction by means of minimizing the L1 norm and total variance. CS-reconstruction fidelity was evaluated quantitatively by comparing fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled image sets.
RESULTS: Helium-3 and (1) H 3D image sets of the lung with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution were acquired during a single breath-hold in 12 s and 8 s using acceleration factors of 2 and 3, respectively. Comparison of fully sampled and retrospectively undersampled (3) He and (1) H images yielded mean absolute errors <10% and structural similarity indices >0.9.
CONCLUSION: By randomly undersampling k-space and using CS reconstruction, high-quality (3) He and (1) H 3D image sets with isotropic 3.9-mm resolution can be acquired within an 8-s breath-hold.},

	Abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package--a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) is essential to the study of acute lung injury. However, quantitative CT is made difficult by poor lung aeration, which complicates the critical step of image segmentation. To overcome this obstacle, this study sought to develop and validate a semiautomated, multilandmark, registration-based scheme for lung segmentation that is effective in conditions of poor aeration. Expiratory and inspiratory CT images were obtained in rats (n = 8) with surfactant depletion of incremental severity to mimic worsening aeration. Trained operators manually delineated the images to provide a comparative landmark. Semiautomatic segmentation originated from a single, previously segmented reference image obtained at healthy baseline. Deformable registration of the target images (after surfactant depletion) was performed using the symmetric diffeomorphic transformation model with B-spline regularization. Registration used multiple landmarks (i.e., rib cage, spine, and lung parenchyma) to minimize the effect of poor aeration. Then target images were automatically segmented by applying the calculated transformation function to the reference image contour. Semiautomatically and manually segmented contours proved to be highly similar in all aeration conditions, including those characterized by more severe surfactant depletion and expiration. The Dice similarity coefficient was over 0.9 in most conditions, confirming high agreement, irrespective of poor aeration. Furthermore, CT density-based measurements of gas volume, tissue mass, and lung aeration distribution were minimally affected by the method of segmentation. Moving forward, multilandmark registration has the potential to streamline quantitative CT analysis by enabling semiautomatic image segmentation of lungs with a broad range of injury severity.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Rapid regional fluctuations in GABA may result in inhomogeneous concentrations throughout the brain parenchyma. The goal of this study is to provide further insight into the natural distribution of GABA throughout the brain and thus determine if a surrogate site may be used for spectroscopy when evaluating motor diseases, neurological disorders, or psychiatric dysfunction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, eight healthy volunteers underwent spectroscopic evaluation of the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, lateral temporal lobe, basal ganglia, and both hippocampi using a spin echo variant of a J-difference editing method. Knowledge of the relative peak intensities of the macromolecule peaks at 3ppm and 0.9ppm was used to correct the contribution of co-edited macromolecules to the GABA peak at 3ppm. The GABA values were internally referenced to NAA. Linear regression was used to normalize the effect of regional tissue-fraction variation on the GABA/NAA values. A one-way ANOVA was performed with Tukey's multiple comparison test to compare the normalized GABA/NAA values in each pair of locations.
RESULTS: After accounting for the macromolecule contribution to the GABA signal and correction for tissue fraction variation, the normalized GABA/NAA ratios differ significantly between the six brain locations (p<0.001). Pairwise comparisons of the corrected normalized GABA/NAA ratios show statistically significant variation between the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia, frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and frontal lobe and right hippocampus. Variations in the normalized GABA/NAA ratios trend toward significance between the frontal lobe and left hippocampus, occipital lobe and the frontal lobe, occipital lobe and basal ganglia, and occipital lobe and right hippocampus.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that GABA concentration is inhomogeneous throughout the parenchyma. Studies evaluating the role of GABA must carefully consider voxel placement when incorporating spectroscopy.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose an accurate methodological framework for automatically segmenting pulmonary proton MRI based on an optimal consensus of a spatially normalized library of annotated lung atlases.
METHODS: A library of 62 manually annotated lung atlases comprising 48 mixed healthy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthmatic subjects of a large age range with multiple ventilation levels is used to produce an optimal segmentation in proton MRI, based on a consensus of the spatially normalized library. An extension of this methodology is used to provide best-guess estimates of lobar subdivisions in proton MRI from annotated computed tomography data.
RESULTS: A leave-one-out evaluation strategy was used for evaluation. Jaccard overlap measures for the left and right lungs were used for performance comparisons relative to the current state-of-the-art (0.966 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.970 $\pm$ 0.016, respectively). Best-guess estimates for the lobes exhibited comparable performance levels (left upper: 0.882 $\pm$ 0.059, left lower: 0.868 $\pm$ 0.06, right upper: 0.852 $\pm$ 0.067, right middle: 0.657 $\pm$ 0.130, right lower: 0.873 $\pm$ 0.063).

Children with ventilation defect percentages in the upper tercile were more likely to have severe asthma than children in the lower terciles (P = .005). The ventilation defect percentage correlated (P < .05 for all) positively with the inhaled corticosteroid dose, total number of controller medications, and total blood eosinophil counts and negatively with the Asthma Control Test score, FEV1 (percent predicted), FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (percent predicted), and forced expiratory flow rate from 25% to 75% of expired volume (percent predicted).
CONCLUSION: The lung defect volume percentage measured by using (3)He MRI correlates with several clinical features of asthma, including severity, symptom score, medication requirement, airway physiology, and atopic markers.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human entorhinal cortex (ERC) connects the temporal neocortex with hippocampus and is essential for memory retrieval and navigation. Markedly, there have been only few quantitative MRI works on the ERC geometric measurements in pediatric and adult healthy subjects across the lifespan. Here, we sought to fill this gap in knowledge by quantifying the ERC thickness in a very large cohort of subjects spanning 9 decades of life.
METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging data from multiple centers (IXI, MMRR, NKI, OASIS combined with the NIH-Child Dev database and locally recruited healthy subjects), we analyzed the lifespan trajectory of ERC thickness in 1,660 healthy controls ranging from 2 to 94 years of age.
RESULTS: The ERC thickness increased with age, reached a peak at about 44 years, and then decreased with age. ERC thickness is hemispherically rightward-asymmetric with no gender differences. Mean ERC thickness was found to vary between 2.943 $\pm$ .438 mm and 3.525 $\pm$ .355 mm across different age populations. Also, more pronounced loss of the ERC thickness in healthy aging men was noticeable.
DISCUSSION: Our report with high spatial resolution brain MRI data from 1,660 healthy controls provided important clues about ERC thickness across lifespan. We believe that our report will pave the way for the future studies investigating distinct neural pathologies related with cognitive dysfunctions.},

@article{Tustison:2014ad,
	Abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size--an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gliomas remain difficult to treat, in part, due to our inability to accurately delineate the margins of the tumor. The goal of our study was to evaluate if a combination of advanced MR imaging techniques and a multimodal imaging model could be used to predict tumor infiltration in patients with diffuse gliomas.
METHODS: Institutional review board approval and written consent were obtained. This prospective pilot study enrolled patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy for a suspected de novo glioma. Stereotactic biopsy coordinates were coregistered with multiple standard and advanced neuroimaging sequences in 10 patients. Objective imaging values were assigned to the biopsy sites for each of the imaging sequences. A principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the imaging dataset without losing important information. A univariate analysis was performed to identify the statistically relevant principal components. Finally, a multivariate analysis was used to build the final model describing nuclear density.
RESULTS: A univariate analysis identified three principal components as being linearly associated with the observed nuclear density (p values 0.021, 0.016, and 0.046, respectively). These three principal component composite scores are predominantly comprised of DTI (mean diffusivity or average diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy) and PWI data (rMTT, Ktrans). The p value of the model was <0.001. The correlation between the predicted and observed nuclear density was 0.75.
CONCLUSION: A multi-input, single output imaging model may predict the extent of glioma invasion with significant correlation with histopathology.},

A custom-built loading device applied compression and permitted load-relaxation outside of the magnet while also maintaining compression and hydration during imaging. Strain was measured through registration of 300 μm isotropic resolution images. Excellent registration accuracy was achieved, with 94% and 65% overlap of disc volume and lamellae compared to manual segmentation, and an average Hausdorff, a measure of distance error, of 0.03 and 0.12 mm for disc volume and lamellae boundaries, respectively. Strain maps enabled qualitative visualization and quantitative regional annulus fibrosus (AF) strain analysis. Axial and circumferential strains were highest in the lateral AF and lowest in the anterior and posterior AF. Radial strains were lowest in the lateral AF, but highly variable. Overall, this study provided new methods that will be valuable in the design and evaluation surgical procedures and therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corticospinal tract (CST) is a reliable surrogate for intraoperative macrostimulation through the deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads. The authors hypothesized that the distance on MRI from the DBS lead to the CST as determined by DTI would correlate with intraoperative motor thresholds from macrostimulations through the same DBS lead.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed pre- and postoperative MRI studies and intraoperative macrostimulation recordings in 17 patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated by DBS stimulation. Preoperative DTI tractography of the CST was coregistered with postoperative MRI studies showing the position of the DBS leads. The shortest distance and the angle from each contact of each DBS lead to the CST was automatically calculated using software-based analysis. The distance measurements calculated for each contact were evaluated with respect to the intraoperative voltage thresholds that elicited a motor response at each contact.
RESULTS: There was a nonsignificant trend for voltage thresholds to increase when the distances between the DBS leads and the CST increased. There was a significant correlation between the angle and the voltage, but the correlation was weak (coefficient of correlation [R] = 0.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Caution needs to be exercised when using DTI tractography information to guide DBS lead placement in patients with PD. Further studies are needed to compare DTI tractography measurements with other approaches such as microelectrode recordings and conventional intraoperative MRI-guided placement of DBS leads.},

	Abstract = {Precise focusing is essential for transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) to minimize collateral damage to non-diseased tissues and to achieve temperatures capable of inducing coagulative necrosis at acceptable power deposition levels. CT is usually used for this refocusing but requires a separate study (CT) ahead of the TcMRgFUS procedure. The goal of this study was to determine whether MRI using an appropriate sequence would be a viable alternative to CT for planning ultrasound refocusing in TcMRgFUS. We tested three MRI pulse sequences (3D T1 weighted 3D volume interpolated breath hold examination (VIBE), proton density weighted 3D sampling perfection with applications optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution and 3D true fast imaging with steady state precision T2-weighted imaging) on patients who have already had a CT scan performed. We made detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the MRI data and compared those so-called 'virtual CT' to detailed measurements of the calvarial structure based on the CT data, used as a reference standard. We then loaded both standard and virtual CT in a TcMRgFUS device and compared the calculated phase correction values, as well as the temperature elevation in a phantom. A series of Bland-Altman measurement agreement analyses showed T1 3D VIBE as the optimal MRI sequence, with respect to minimizing the measurement discrepancy between the MRI derived total skull thickness measurement and the CT derived total skull thickness measurement (mean measurement discrepancy: 0.025; 95% CL (-0.22-0.27); p = 0.825). The T1-weighted sequence was also optimal in estimating skull CT density and skull layer thickness. The mean difference between the phase shifts calculated with the standard CT and the virtual CT reconstructed from the T1 dataset was 0.08 $\pm$ 1.2 rad on patients and 0.1 $\pm$ 0.9 rad on phantom. Compared to the real CT, the MR-based correction showed a 1 $\,^{\circ}$C drop on the maximum temperature elevation in the phantom (7% relative drop). Without any correction, the maximum temperature was down 6 $\,^{\circ}$C (43% relative drop). We have developed an approach that allows for a reconstruction of a virtual CT dataset from MRI to perform phase correction in TcMRgFUS.},

	Abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	Abstract = {Non-uniform distribution of inspired gas within the lung, termed ventilation heterogeneity, is present in patients with even mild asthma. Current evidence strongly supports ventilation heterogeneity as a fundamental derangement of lung function in asthma that contributes per se to hypoxemia and airway hyper-responsiveness. An extreme example of ventilation heterogeneity is the identification by hyperpolarized gas MRI of lung regions with no ventilation, termed filling defects. Lung filling defects in patients with asthma can persist over time, increase in size with methacholine-induced bronchospasm and more likely are caused by obstruction of the peripheral and not the proximal airways. Ventilation heterogeneity can be quantified in the conducting and acinar lung zones with the multiple gas washout method, and in the acinar zone does not fully resolve following bronchodilator treatment in patients with asthma. In prospective studies, the degree of ventilation heterogeneity at baseline predicts airway hyper-responsiveness and response to corticosteroid dose titration. An important unanswered question is the relationship of airways inflammation to ventilation heterogeneity. In consideration of the importance of ventilation heterogeneity in its pathobiology, asthma is more a focal disorder with regional pathology akin to regional ileitis and not the generalized disorder of the airways as it has been viewed in the past.},

	Abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Fourteen patients were ultimately included. DT MR imaging studies at 3.0 T were performed preoperatively and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated from the DT imaging data sets for all time points in all patients. Voxels where FA consistently decreased over time were identified, and FA change in these voxels was correlated with clinical changes in tremor over the same period by using Pearson correlation.
RESULTS: Ipsilateral brain structures that showed prespecified negative correlation values of FA over time of -0.5 or less included the pre- and postcentral subcortical white matter in the hand knob area; the region of the corticospinal tract in the centrum semiovale, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the cerebral peduncle; the thalamus; the region of the red nucleus; the location of the central tegmental tract; and the region of the inferior olive. The contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral portions of the superior vermis also showed persistent decrease in FA over time. There was strong correlation between decrease in FA and clinical improvement in hand tremor 3 months after lesion inducement (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy depicts changes in specific brain structures. The magnitude of the DT imaging changes after thalamic lesion inducement correlates with the degree of clinical improvement in essential tremor.},

	Abstract = {Diffeomorphic mappings are central to image registration due largely to their topological properties and success in providing biologically plausible solutions to deformation and morphological estimation problems. Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository.

	Abstract = {Current research investigating the modeling of left ventricular dynamics for accurate clinical assessment of cardiac function is extensive. Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

	Abstract = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models--one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains for the normal human data are also included.},

	Abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},

This computational framework was applied to a study consisting of 55 subjects (47 asthmatic and eight normal). Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces. Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces. Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic analysis was performed on three volunteers.
RESULTS: Tag lines in inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous 3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged (3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	Abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing.

	Abstract = {The effects of certain lung pathologies include alterations in lung physiology negatively affecting pulmonary compliance. Current approaches to diagnosis and treatment assessment of lung disease commonly rely on pulmonary function testing. Such testing is limited to global measures of lung function, neglecting regional measurements, which are critical for early diagnosis and localization of disease. Increased accessibility to medical image acquisition strategies with high spatiotemporal resolution coupled with the development of sophisticated intensity-based and geometric registration techniques has resulted in the recent exploration of modeling pulmonary motion for calculating local measures of deformation. In this review, the authors provide a broad overview of such research efforts for the estimation of pulmonary deformation. This includes discussion of various techniques, current trends in validation approaches, and the public availability of software and data resources.},

	Abstract = {In adult canines following major lung resection, the remaining lobes expand asymmetrically, associated with alveolar tissue regrowth, remodeling, and progressive functional compensation over many months. To permit noninvasive longitudinal assessment of regional growth and function, we performed serial high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) on six male dogs (∼9 mo old, 25.0 $\pm$ 4.5 kg, $\pm$SD) at 15 and 30 cmH(2)O transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) before resection (PRE) and 3 and 15 mo postresection (POST3 and POST15, respectively) of 65-70% of lung units. At POST3, lobar air volume increased 83-148% and tissue (including microvascular blood) volume 120-234% above PRE values without further changes at POST15. Lobar-specific compliance (Cs) increased 52-137% from PRE to POST3 and 28-79% from POST3 to POST15. Inflation-related parenchyma strain and shear were estimated by detailed registration of corresponding anatomical features at each Ptp. Within each lobe, regional displacement was most pronounced at the caudal region, whereas strain was pronounced in the periphery. Regional three-dimensional strain magnitudes increased heterogeneously from PRE to POST3, with further medial-lateral increases from POST3 to POST15. Lobar principal strains (PSs) were unchanged or modestly elevated postresection; changes in lobar maximum PS correlated inversely with changes in lobar air and tissue volumes. Lobar shear distortion increased in coronal and transverse planes at POST3 without further changes thereafter. These results establish a novel use of functional HRCT to map heterogeneous regional deformation during compensatory lung growth and illustrate a stimulus-response feedback loop whereby postresection mechanical stress initiates differential lobar regrowth and sustained remodeling, which in turn, relieves parenchyma stress and strain, resulting in progressive increases in lobar Cs and a delayed increase in whole lung Cs.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

@article{Barbosa:2011aa,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi-detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels > -50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels < -950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters.
RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity (r = 0.83). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum r value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume (r = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema.
CONCLUSIONS: Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway-related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

@article{Song:2012aa,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of various image-based metrics computed from thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with data from pulmonary function testing (PFT) in characterizing interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with ILD and 11 with COPD had undergone both PFT and HRCT within 3 days. For each patient, 93 image-based metrics were computed, and their relationships with the 21 clinically used PFT parameters were analyzed using a minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance statistical framework. The first 20 features were selected among the total of 114 mixed image metrics and PFT values in the characterization of ILD and COPD.
RESULTS: Among the best-performing 20 features, 14 were image metrics, derived from attenuation histograms and texture descriptions. The highest relevance value computed from PFT parameters was 0.47, and the highest from image metrics was 0.52, given the theoretical bound as [0, 0.69]. The ILD or COPD classifier using the first four features achieved a 1.92% error rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Some image metrics are not only as good discriminators as PFT for the characterization of ILD and COPD but are also not redundant when PFT values are provided. Image metrics of attenuation histogram statistics and texture descriptions may be valuable for further investigation in computer-assisted diagnosis.},
