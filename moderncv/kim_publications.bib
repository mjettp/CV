	Abstract = {A model of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-induced vascular calcification (VC) that complicates the metabolic syndrome was produced. In this model, the metabolic syndrome is characterized by severe atherosclerotic plaque formation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia, and CKD stimulates calcification of the neointima and tunica media of the aorta. The CKD in this model is associated the adynamic bone disorder form of renal osteodystrophy. The VC of the model is associated with hyperphosphatemia, and control of the serum phosphorus both in this animal model and in humans has been preventive in the development of VC. This article reports studies that demonstrate reduction of established VC by the addition of sevelamer carbonate to the diets of this murine metabolic syndrome model with CKD. Sevelamer, besides normalizing the serum phosphorus, surprisingly, reversed the CKD-induced trabecular osteopenia. Sevelamer therapy increased osteoblast surfaces in the metaphyseal trabeculae of the tibia and femur. It also increased osteoid surfaces and, importantly, bone formation rates. In addition, sevelamer was found to be effective in decreasing serum cholesterol levels. These results suggest that sevelamer may have important actions in decreasing diabetic and uremic vasculopathy and that sevelamer carbonate may be capable of increasing bone formation rates that are suppressed by diabetic nephropathy.},

	Abstract = {The microcolony assay originally described by Withers and Elkind in 1970 (1) has been a useful method for investigating the effects of radiation and various other genotoxic and cytotoxic damaging agents on the intestinal epithelial stem cell population and to assess the ability of a variety of compounds to protect the epithelial stem cell population from the lethal effects of chemical and physical agents (e.g., 2-7). Epithelial stem cells are located near the base of each intestinal crypt and play an important role in normal epithelial renewal and differentiation, epithelial injury-repair, and in neoplastic transformation (8-11). In the adult mouse small intestine these functionally anchored clonogenic stem cells divide rarely to produce a daughter stem cell (self renewal) as well as a more rapidly replicating transit cell. Transit cells, in turn, undergo a number of rapid cell divisions in the proliferative zone located in the lower half of each crypt. Their progeny subsequently differentiate into the mature epithelial cell types found in the small intestine as they migrate away from the proliferative zone in each intestinal crypt (8-11). Following intestinal injury and disruption of the epithelium, epithelial cells adjacent to the wound first migrate over the injured area to reestablish continuity of the epithelium. Stem cells subsequently proliferate to increase their numbers and to give rise to the more rapidly proliferating transit cell population. The transit cell population then expands rapidly to form a regenerative crypt. If the injury has completely destroyed some crypts, the surviving regenerative crypts can subsequently branch and divide to restore near normal numbers of viable crypts (3).},

	Abstract = {Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification have emerged as cardiovascular risk factors among those with chronic kidney disease. This study examined the mechanism by which phosphorous stimulates vascular calcification, as well as how controlling hyperphosphatemia affects established calcification. In primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from atherosclerotic human aortas, activation of osteoblastic events, including increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and the transcription factor RUNX2, which normally play roles in skeletal morphogenesis, was observed. These changes, however, did not lead to matrix mineralization until the phosphorus concentration of the media was increased; phosphorus stimulated expression of osterix, a second critical osteoblast transcription factor. Knockdown of osterix with small interference RNA (siRNA) or antagonism of BMP-2 with noggin prevented matrix mineralization in vitro. Similarly, vascular BMP-2 and RUNX2 were upregulated in atherosclerotic mice, but significant mineralization occurred only after the induction of renal dysfunction, which led to hyperphosphatemia and increased aortic expression of osterix. Administration of oral phosphate binders or intraperitoneal BMP-7 decreased expression of osterix and aortic mineralization. It is concluded that, in chronic kidney disease, hyperphosphatemia stimulates an osteoblastic transcriptional program in the vasculature, which is mediated by osterix activation in cells of the vascular tunica media and neointima.},
