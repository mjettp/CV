	Abstract = {Although 3He MRI permits compelling visualization of the pulmonary air spaces, quantitation of absolute ventilation is
difficult due to confounds such as field inhomogeneity and relative intensity differences between image acquisition; the
latter complicating longitudinal investigations of ventilation variation with respiratory alterations. To address these
potential difficulties, we present a 4-D segmentation and normalization approach for intra-subject quantitative analysis of
lung hyperpolarized 3He MRI. After normalization, which combines bias correction and relative intensity scaling
between longitudinal data, partitioning of the lung volume time series is performed by iterating between modeling of the
combined intensity histogram as a Gaussian mixture model and modulating the spatial heterogeneity tissue class
assignments through Markov random field modeling. Evaluation of the algorithm was retrospectively applied to a cohort
of 10 asthmatics between 19-25 years old in which spirometry and 3He MR ventilation images were acquired both
before and after respiratory exacerbation by a bronchoconstricting agent (methacholine). Acquisition was repeated under
the same conditions from 7 to 467 days (mean $\pm$ standard deviation: 185 &amp;plusmn; 37.2) later. Several techniques were
evaluated for matching intensities between the pre and post-methacholine images with the 95th percentile value
histogram matching demonstrating superior correlations with spirometry measures. Subsequent analysis evaluated
segmentation parameters for assessing ventilation change in this cohort. Current findings also support previous research
that areas of poor ventilation in response to bronchoconstriction are relatively consistent over time.},

	Abstract = {
The recent discovery of methodological flaws in experimental design and analysis in neuroscience research has raised concerns over the validity of certain techniques used in routine analyses and their corresponding findings. Such concerns have centered around selection bias whereby data is inadvertently manipulated such that the resulting analysis produces falsely increased statistical significance, i.e. type I errors. This has been illustrated recently in flv1RI studies, with excessive flexibility in data collection, and general experimental design issues. Current work from our group has shown how this problem extends to generic voxel-based analysis (and certain technique derivatives such as tract- based spatial statistics) using fractional anisotropy images derived from diffusion tensor imaging. In this work, we demonstrate how this circularity principle can potentially extend to the well-known optimized voxel-based morphometry technique for assessing cortical density differences whereby the principal cause of experimental corruption is due to normalization strategy. Specifically, the popular sum- of-squared-differences (SSD) metric explicitly optimizes statistical findings potentially inflating type I errors. Additional experimentation demonstrates that this problem is not restricted to the SSD metric but extends to other commonly used metrics such as mutual information, neighborhood cross correlation, and Demons.

The utitlity of pulmonary functional imaging techniques, such as hyperpolarized 3He MRI, has encouraged their inclusion in research studies for longitudinal assessment of disease progression and the study of treatment effects. We present methodology for performing voxelwise statistical analysis of ventilation maps derived from hyper- polarized 3He MRI which incorporates multivariate template construction using simultaneous acquisition of IH and 3He images. Additional processing steps include intensity normalization, bias correction, 4-D longitudinal segmentation, and generation of expected ventilation maps prior to voxelwise regression analysis. Analysis is demonstrated on a cohort of eight individuals with diagnosed cystic fibrosis (CF) undergoing treatment imaged five times every two weeks with a prescribed treatment schedule.

	Abstract = {
Numerous studies have explored the relationship between cortical structure and brain development, cognitive function, and functional connectivity. The highly convoluted cortical topography makes manual measurements arduous and often impractical given the population sizes necessary for sufficient statistical power. Computational techniques have permitted large-scale studies as they provide robust and reliable localized measurements characterizing the cortex with little or no human intervention. Particularly useful to the neuroscience community are publicly available tools, such as the popular surface-based Freesurfer, which facilitate the testing and refinement of hypotheses. In this paper, we introduce the volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness automated pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness) all developed as part of the ANTs open science effort. Complementing the open source aspect of ANTs we demonstrate its utility using the publicly available IXI data set.

	Abstract = {An essential component of many medical image analysis protocols is the establishment and manipulation of feature correspondences. These image features can assume such forms spanning the range of functions of individual or regional pixel intensities to geometric structures extracted as a preprocessing segmentation step. Many algorithms focusing on the latter set of salient features attempt to reduce these structures to such geometric primitives as surfaces, curves and/or points for correspondence-based study. Although the latter geometric primitive forms the basis of many of these algorithms, unrealistic constraints such as assumptions of identical cardinality between point-sets hinder general usage. Furthermore, the local structure for certain point-sets derived from segmentation processes is often ignored. In this paper, we introduce a family of novel information-theoretic measures for pooint-set registration derived as a generalization of the well-known Shannon entropy known as the Havrda-Charvat-Tsallis entropy. This divergence measure permits a fine-tuning between robustness and sensitivity emphasis. In addition, we employ a directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) transformation model, a recently developed variant of the well-known FFD transformation model.},

	Abstract = {Assessing the quality of motion estimation in the lung remains challenging. We approach the problem by imaging isolated porcine lungs within an artificial thorax with four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). Respiratory kinematics are estimated via pairwise non-rigid registration using different metrics and image resolutions. Landmarks are manually identified on the images and used to assess accuracy by comparing known displacements to the registration-derived displacements. We find that motion quantitation becomes less precise as the inflation interval between images increases. In addition, its sensitivity to image resolution varies anatomically. Mutual information and cross-correlation perform similarly, while mean squares is significantly poorer. However, none of the metrics compensate for the difficulty of registering over a large inflation interval. We intend to use the results of these experiments to more effectively and efficiently quantify pulmonary kinematics in future, and to explore additional parameter combinations.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for reliable, unbiased, multivariate longitudinal analysis of cortical and white matter atrophy rates with penalized statistical methods. The pipeline uses a step-wise approach to transform and personalize template information first to a single-subject template (SST) and then to the individual's time series data. The first stream of information flows from group template to the SST; the second flows from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased, prior-based segmentation and measurement of cortical thickness. MRI-bias correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces (a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when combined with sparse canonical correlation analysis--reveals plausible, significant, annualized decline in cortical thickness and white matter volume when contrasting frontotemporal dementia and normal aging.},

To overcome the inherent difficulties associated with this segmentation problem, we present a new method of information integration in a graph based framework. In addition to image intensity, tissue priors and local boundary information are integrated into the edge weight metrics in the graph. Furthermore, inhomogeneity correction is incorporated by adaptively adjusting the edge weights according to the intermediate inhomogeneity estimation. In the validation experiments of simulated brain MRIs, the proposed method outperformed a segmentation method based on iterated conditional modes (ICM), which is a commonly used optimization method in medical image segmentation. In the experiments of real neonatal brain MRIs, the results of the proposed method have good overlap with the manual segmentations by human experts.},
